# assetZ — AI-Native CMMS for Manufacturing

## Project Overview

assetZ is a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS) built by chaiT, designed specifically for manufacturing environments. It combines a traditional CMMS data engine with an AI agent as the primary interface, graph-native asset relationship intelligence, and intelligent facility floor plans with real-time status visualization.

**Team:**
- Matt — Product, frontend (Next.js), maintenance domain expert (maintenance manager at SOLLiD Cabinetry)
- Grant — Backend, data engineering (Python/FastAPI, PostgreSQL, 10 years Python/SQL)

**This repo is the frontend.** The backend is a separate Python/FastAPI repo managed by Grant.

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Smart ID System
assetZ auto-generates two types of IDs:

**Facility Asset ID** — structured, human-readable:
`[Company]-[Building]-[Department]-[SystemType]-[UnitType]-[DependencyCode][Group]-[Sequence]`

Rules:
- Dashes (`-`) are STRICTLY field separators only
- Underscores (`_`) handle multi-word values within a field (e.g., `EDGE_BANDER`, `AUTO_SPRAYBOOTH`)
- Department code = physical location of asset, NOT equipment category
- Dependency codes:
  - `L` = Production Line — equipment is directly coupled, one stops the line stops
  - `C` = Independent Cell — group of same-type equipment, not mechanically dependent
  - `U` = Utility — serves multiple departments (compressors, dust collection, HVAC)
- Cell numbers are sequential per equipment type per department (C1 = first type, C2 = second type). Only one cell number per equipment type per department. Cell numbers reset per department.

Examples:
```
SC-B1-MIL-EDGE-EDGE_BANDER-C1-01
SC-B1-MIL-CNC-ROVER-C2-01
SC-B1-MIL-CNC-SKILL-C3-01
SC-B1-MIL-CNC-DRILLTEQ-C4-01
SC-B1-MIL-CNC-BEAM_SAW-C5-01
SC-B1-MIL-JOIN-DOVETAILER-C6-01
SC-B1-FIN-SPRAY-AUTO_SPRAYBOOTH-C1-01   ← Finishing has its own C1
SC-B1-FAC-AIR-COMPRESSOR-U1-01
```

**IMPORTANT:** The "C3" in `SC-B1-MIL-CNC-ROVER-C3-04` means Cell 3 in the Mill department — it is NOT a map grid coordinate. Cell refers to a logical grouping of same-type equipment within a department. The alphanumeric grid location on the floor plan (e.g., "C-7") is a separate field entirely.

**Asset Number / Barcode** — short, sequential, scannable:
`[CompanyPrefix]-[TypeCode]-[4-digit sequence]`
Asset number = barcode number (always the same value).
Examples: `SLD-ROV-0001`, `SLD-EB-0001`

**Part Numbers:** Manufacturer part number = system part number. No internal numbering.

### 2. Two-Tier Dependency Model (Graph)
- **DEPENDS_ON** = Direct/mechanical. Machine B cannot run if Machine A is down. Line (L) equipment only. Immediate red alert.
- **FEEDS** = Indirect/operational. Asset output feeds another department with a time buffer. Cell (C) and Utility (U) assets. Yellow warning with countdown based on buffer time.

### 3. AI Agent — Dual Interface
- **Sidebar Chat (collapsible):** Open-ended conversations, complex queries, setup, troubleshooting
- **Inline Smart Prompts:** Contextual suggestions appearing naturally during workflows. Non-intrusive, dismissable, one-tap actionable.

### 4. Real-Time via WebSocket
Dashboard KPIs, floor plan asset status, notifications, and in-WO updates all push via WebSocket. No polling. No manual refresh. This directly solves the sync issues found in Asset Essentials.

### 5. Red/Yellow/Green Status System
Measured against DUE DATE, not creation date:
- 🟢 Green: On-time completion OR 3+ days remaining
- 🟡 Yellow: 1–2 days remaining
- 🔴 Red: Past due

### 6. Stoplight Visual Design
Stoplights render like REAL traffic signals — all three circles (red, yellow, green) are always visible. The active status is full brightness with a subtle glow effect. The inactive circles are dim (~15-20% opacity) but still present. This applies to:
- Technician scoreboard rows (each tech has a stoplight)
- TV/kiosk mode (large stoplights, highly visible across the shop floor)
- Any status indicator that uses the stoplight metaphor

This is NOT a single colored dot. It is three stacked circles where only one is "lit."

### 7. In-App Chat & Voice-to-Text
**Chat/Messaging:**
- In-app messaging with threaded conversations per work order (like MaintainX — their #1 rated feature)
- Direct messages between techs, managers, requesters
- @mentions in comments
- Photo/video attachments in chat threads
- Notification preferences per user

**Voice-to-Text (critical for manufacturing floor use):**
- Microphone button available on ALL text input fields throughout the app — not just chat
- Use cases: chat messages, WO completion notes, WO comments, PM task descriptions, search, asset notes
- Manufacturing context: techs have dirty/greasy hands, wear gloves, stand next to running machines. Typing on a phone is impractical. Voice input is the primary input method on the floor.
- AI-assisted voice processing: tech says "finished replacing the drive belt on Rover 3, took about 45 minutes, used one Gates belt from the parts room" → AI structures into: action taken, time logged (45 min), parts consumed (1x Gates belt). No manual form filling.
- Voice-to-summary on completed WOs: tech records voice note → AI structures into formatted completion summary

### 8. Asset Reference Cards (Quick Reference Guides)
Every asset can have a **Reference Card** — a structured quick-reference document that surfaces automatically inside any work order for that asset. When a tech opens a WO, the reference card is one tap away (collapsible panel or tab within the WO detail view).

**Reference Card contents:**
- Standard PM procedures and checklists for this specific asset
- Safety warnings and lockout/tagout requirements
- Common failure modes and their fixes
- Recommended spare parts with part numbers
- Lubrication points and schedules
- Belt/filter replacement intervals and specs
- Photos of key maintenance points (e.g., "grease fitting is HERE")
- Links to full manufacturer manuals (stored in graphX document system)
- Troubleshooting decision tree (if symptom X → check Y first)

**How it gets built:**
- Maintenance teams create reference cards per asset or per asset MODEL (so one card covers all 4 Biesse Rovers)
- Upload PDFs, images, or fill in structured templates within assetZ
- Cards are living documents — editable, versioned, with change history

**AI Enhancement (future):**
- AI reads the full manufacturer manual (via graphX) and auto-generates a draft reference card
- AI assistant in WO context can answer questions using the reference card + manual as knowledge base
- Two modes when AI assists on a WO:
  - **Fix Only** — Quick answer, get the machine running, minimal explanation. For time-critical situations.
  - **Fix & Train** — Step-by-step guidance with explanations of WHY each step matters. For when there's time to learn. Builds technician skill over time.
- AI tracks which fixes a tech has done before vs. first-time encounters, adjusting guidance depth automatically

### 9. VR-Assisted Maintenance (Future — Phase 4+)
Augmented/virtual reality integration for hands-on guided maintenance:
- VR headset (or AR glasses) overlays step-by-step repair instructions onto the physical equipment
- **LiDAR scanning** for real-time spatial awareness — the system knows what it's looking at
- Live diagnosis: scan a machine, system identifies the model, pulls up the reference card, and walks through the repair visually
- Remote expert mode: a senior tech or OEM specialist can see what the field tech sees and guide them through the repair in real-time
- Integration with assetZ WO system — repair steps, time, and parts are logged automatically as the tech works

### 10. 3D Equipment Scanning & Virtual Disassembly (Future — Phase 4+)
Scan physical machines to create interactive 3D models that can be virtually disassembled:
- **External scanning** via LiDAR/photogrammetry to capture the machine's exterior geometry and produce a 3D rendering
- **Internal modeling** supplemented by manufacturer documentation, exploded diagrams, and CAD files (since you can't scan internals without physical disassembly)
- AI combines scanned exterior + online literature + manufacturer data to build a complete virtual model
- **Virtual teardown**: tech can "pull apart" the 3D model layer by layer to understand how components relate, identify the part that's likely failed, and see how to access it
- **Troubleshooting mode**: describe a symptom → AI highlights the most likely failed components in the 3D model and shows the disassembly path to reach them
- Parts identification: scan an unknown part with a phone camera → AI matches it to the 3D model and returns the part number, supplier, and inventory status

### 11. Facility Walkthrough Scanning & Digital Twin (Future — Phase 4+)
Walk the entire building with a scanning device to build the complete digital facility in one pass:
- LiDAR/scanning device captures the full 3D environment as you physically move through the building
- **Tag-as-you-go**: during the walkthrough, identify and tag assets, departments, racking sections, aisles, storage areas — "this is Mill department, this is a Biesse Rover, this rack section is laminate inventory"
- System auto-generates: 2D floor plan, 3D navigable environment, asset registry entries, department zone boundaries, racking layouts, aisle paths — all from the single walkthrough
- **Replaces weeks of manual CMMS onboarding** with a 2-hour facility walk
- The 3D walkthrough becomes a replayable virtual environment for new employee orientation and training
- Periodic re-scans detect layout changes (moved equipment, new racking, reconfigured departments) and flag diffs against the previous scan

## Interactive Floor Plan — Architecture & Design Decisions

The floor plan is one of assetZ's primary competitive differentiators. It is NOT a static image with pins — it's a living, interactive blueprint rendered from actual CAD data.

### Visual Theme: Dark Blue CAD Canvas (Always Dark)
The floor plan canvas is ALWAYS dark blue (`#162032`) regardless of the app's light/dark mode setting. The rest of the app (sidebar, headers, asset cards, dashboards) follows the global theme, but the map canvas stays dark. This is the same pattern as Figma — UI can be light or dark, canvas is its own thing.

**Rationale:** Status LEDs (green/yellow/red) need maximum contrast to be instantly scannable. A maintenance manager glancing at the map needs red and yellow dots to jump out immediately. Dark canvas makes that happen.

**Canvas colors:**
- Background: `#162032` (dark navy-blue)
- Wall/structure linework: `#5b8dd9` at ~55% opacity
- Equipment outlines: `#7cb3f4` (lighter blue, slightly brighter than walls)
- Storage/racking: `#3d6494` at ~45% opacity (present but not dominant)
- Grid lines: `#1e2d47` (very subtle)
- Grid text: `#3d5a80`
- Aisle lines: `#2e4a6e` dashed
- Department labels: `#4a6d94` default, `#93c5fd` on hover/click
- Asset labels: `#6a8db8` (monospace, below equipment footprint)
- Tooltip background: `#152033` with `#1e2d47` border

**Global Theme System:**
- Light / Dark / System toggle lives in sidebar footer or Settings page — NOT on the floor plan page
- System mode detects OS `prefers-color-scheme` and follows automatically
- Theme persists per user
- Floor plan page: header bar and detail panel follow global theme; map canvas always dark

### Rendering Approach: DXF-to-SVG Pipeline
The floor plan base layer is generated by converting the facility's DXF (CAD) file to SVG format programmatically. This is vector art, so it stays crisp at any zoom level.

**Layers to render from DXF:**
- Building (walls, structural elements) — solid lines
- Aisles (traffic corridors) — dashed lines
- Storage and Buffer (rack layouts)
- Workbenches Plantequipment
- Machines — rendered as simplified bounding box outlines, NOT full block geometry (machine blocks have 9,000–27,000 lines each — way too heavy for web rendering)

**What the DXF does NOT contain (for SOLLiD's file):**
- The architectural envelope (walls, exterior) lives in a missing XREF. The Building layer only has partial structural elements. The annotated facility screenshot (`sollid-facility-layout-annotated.png`) is the ground truth for building outline and department positioning.

### Equipment Footprints = The Interactive Elements
- Equipment is rendered as **simplified CAD-style outlines** — architectural/engineering symbol quality, matching what you'd see on a real engineering drawing. NOT cartoon icons, NOT colored dots.
- Each footprint is extracted from the DXF machine blocks as a simplified bounding outline — same shape and proportions, reduced line count.
- The equipment footprint itself IS the clickable element. The ENTIRE rectangle/shape is the click target, not just a corner dot.
- **There is NO separation between "Equipment" and "Asset Pins." Equipment IS the asset. One thing, one representation.**

### Status Indicators (LED Dots)
Small dot (8–10px) sits in the top-right corner of each equipment footprint, like a physical LED on the machine:
- 🟢 Green = Operational
- 🟡 Yellow/Orange = PM Due
- 🔴 Red = Down / Open Work Order
- 🟡 Pulsing animated ring = Active maintenance in progress (a technician is currently working on it)
- ⚫ Gray = Decommissioned

### Asset Labeling on the Map
**Normal zoom:** Short recognizable label — e.g., `ROVER-C3-04` (the unique portion of the facility asset ID)
**Hover tooltip:** Full facility asset ID + machine name — e.g., `SC-B1-MIL-CNC-ROVER-C3-04 — Biesse Rover B 1531`
**Click → Detail panel** shows:
- Facility Asset ID: SC-B1-MIL-CNC-ROVER-C3-04
- Asset Number/Barcode: SLD-ROV-0004
- Equipment: Biesse Rover B 1531
- Department: Mill
- Cell: 3
- Grid Location: C-7 (from the alphanumeric blueprint grid — separate from cell number)
- DXF Reference: #47 (legacy CAD reference number, useful for cross-referencing the original blueprint)
- Status with color indicator
- Last work order summary
- Next PM due date
- Quick action buttons: Work Order, PM Schedule, Parts List, Asset History
- "Find in Asset Registry" button to navigate to full asset detail page

### Alphanumeric Grid System
The map uses a blueprint-style grid, NOT raw DXF coordinates:
- **Numbers 1–15 across the top** — matching the structural column grid from the DXF (47'-4" first bay, then 56'-0" bays)
- **Letters (A–F or similar) down the left side** — evenly dividing the building height
- A location reads as "C-7" or "D-12" — like reading a map grid reference
- This is how maintenance techs reference locations on the floor

### Department Zones
- Defined as invisible interactive polygon overlays on top of the blueprint — the blueprint art always shows through
- **Default state:** Gray text label, always visible, centered within the zone
- **Hover:** Label turns blue
- **Click:** Label turns blue AND zone boundary appears as subtle dashed outline; filters to show only that department's assets
- Department zones should NOT be visible colored boxes that obscure the blueprint

**All departments for SOLLiD (from DXF + annotated screenshot):**
Mill, Kitting, Assembly, Finishing, White Wood, Maintenance, Receiving, Shipping Docks, West Storage & Racking, East End Storage & Racking, Showroom, Lobby, Operations Offices & Cubicles, Bathrooms & Storage, Breakroom & Food, Sales Tools, Grill Patio, Conference Room, Forklift Repair, Welding, Paint/Lacquer Storage, Dust Collector Storage, Air Compressor & Chiller Room, Laminate Inventory, Color Room, Face Frame Manufacturing, WW Prep, Repair & Glazing, Value Series Inventory, Flatstock Incoming, LTL, Finished Good Storage

### Layer Toggles (Layers Panel)
- Building Structure (walls, columns, doors)
- Column Grid (alphanumeric overlay)
- Assets (equipment footprints with status indicators)
- Storage & Racking
- Aisles & Transport
- Department Labels (hover/click zones)
- Active Maintenance (pulsing indicators)
- Phase 2 Layout (future equipment from DXF Phase2 layer)

### Dependency Visualization on Floor Plan (Future — scaffold data model now)
When a user clicks an asset and selects "Show Dependencies" or "Show Flow":
- **DEPENDS_ON** relationships render as **solid red directional arrows** between equipment
- **FEEDS** relationships render as **dashed yellow directional arrows** showing material flow with time buffer
- **Impact visualization:** Click a DOWN (red) asset → "Show Impact" highlights every downstream asset affected, arrows turn red, creating a visual cascade showing what's blocked
- **Production flow mode:** Toggle to show all material flow arrows across the facility — how raw material enters and flows through departments to finished goods

### Map Builder (Edit Mode)
Activated via the "Map Builder" button in the floor plan UI. This is the self-service facility map editor:
- **Equipment Icon Library sidebar** with categorized sections: CNC Machines, Edge Banders, Panel Saws, Conveyors, Storage/Racking, Workbenches, Material Handling, Utility Systems
- Icons are **blueprint-style SVG footprints** (engineering quality, not clip art) stored in `/public/assets/equipment-icons/`
- Each icon file is named to match the DXF block name (e.g., `biesse-rover-1531.svg`, `homag-bhx-500.svg`, `sawstop.svg`)
- **Drag from library → drop on map** → positions the equipment → prompt for asset ID, equipment name, department assignment
- Snap-to-grid option for clean alignment
- Department zone boundary drawing tool (polygon)
- Production flow arrow drawing tool
- Undo/redo for all edits
- Save draft / publish workflow (edits don't affect live map until published)
- All asset positions stored in a **single JSON data file** — single source of truth, easy to manually edit

### DXF Reference Data (SOLLiD Facility — G2.5 EQUIPMENT LAYOUT EGRESS-2.dxf)
- **File:** 46 MB, 5.4M lines, 3,198 model-space entities, 300 block definitions
- **Coordinate system:** 1 unit = 1 inch, Imperial
- **Building extents:** X: ~1,200–9,500 in, Y: ~350–4,300 in (~690' wide × ~330' tall)
- **Machine blocks scale:** 0.039 (mm→in conversion, block geometry drawn in mm)
- **Exception:** CeflaLines_20200916_V2 at scale=11.99 (different unit system)
- **Asset Number layer:** 107 MTEXT labels (#1–#258) positioned at each machine location — these are the asset position coordinates
- **Key layers:** Machines (495 entities), Storage and Buffer (1,053), Workbenches (379), Building (168), Asset Number (107), Aisles (101), Transport Equipment (96), DepartmentLabel (17)
- **Missing XREF:** X-PLAN-FLR1 (architectural walls/columns/doors) not embedded — 90+ architectural layers exist in layer table but have no geometry

## API Base URL

Development: `http://localhost:8000/api`
The backend API documentation (when running) will be at `http://localhost:8000/docs` (FastAPI auto-generates Swagger UI).

## Coding Conventions

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Components are functional with hooks (no class components)
- File naming: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components
- API calls go through a centralized client in `lib/api-client.ts`
- WebSocket connections managed through `lib/ws-manager.ts`
- All types matching the backend schema live in `types/`
- Tailwind for styling — no CSS modules, no styled-components
- Mobile-first responsive design (this is used on the shop floor)
- Commit after every working feature — small, atomic commits

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Core CMMS (Weeks 1–8)**
Goal: Functional enough to replace Asset Essentials at SOLLiD for daily operations.

Priority build order:
1. ✅ Project scaffolding, auth pages, app shell with sidebar nav
2. ✅ Asset registry (CRUD, detail views, barcode display)
3. ✅ Work order management (create, status workflow, comments, photos)
4. ✅ KPI dashboard with placeholder data
5. ✅ PM schedule management
6. ✅ Parts inventory with reservation UI
7. ✅ Red/Yellow/Green scoreboard
8. 🟡 Settings and configuration
9. 🟡 Interactive floor plan (DXF-to-SVG pipeline built, needs correction pass)

## Important Context

This product is being dogfooded at SOLLiD Cabinetry (cabinet manufacturing) as the first production deployment. The maintenance team will use this daily. Manufacturing floor conditions apply — the mobile experience must work with gloves, in poor lighting, and under time pressure. Fast, clear, scannable.

SOLLiD is a ~690' × 330' cabinet manufacturing facility with Biesse CNC machines, HOMAG boring centers, Cefla finishing lines, edge banders, panel saws, and extensive racking/storage. Matt is actively implementing Asset Essentials there and using that hands-on experience to identify pain points that assetZ solves.
