| 16 | Periodic re-scan to detect layout changes (moved equipment, new racking, etc.) | 🔴 | Diff against previous scan to flag what changed |

*Note: VR/AR and 3D scanning represent the long-term vision for assetZ. These features would put assetZ in a category no CMMS competitor currently occupies. Start with simpler AR (phone camera-based, not full headset) and build toward full VR as hardware becomes more accessible on the shop floor. The 3D model library would be built incrementally — each scanned machine adds to the library for all customers using that equipment model. The facility walkthrough is the ultimate onboarding tool — one physical walk replaces weeks of manual setup. The walkthrough also becomes a living digital twin that stays in sync with the real facility through periodic re-scans.*

## COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATORS (What No One Else Has)

These are the features that make assetZ unique vs MaintainX, Limble, UpKeep, Fiix, and Asset Essentials:

1. **⭐ Graph-Powered Dependency Intelligence** — DEPENDS_ON and FEEDS relationships with real-time cascade alerts. No competitor models operational dependencies with buffer times and countdown warnings.

2. **⭐ Living Floor Plan** — Not just static pins (competitors). Real-time status colors, dependency chain overlays, ripple animations on failure, heat maps, production flow visualization.

3. **⭐ AI-Native from Day One** — Not bolted-on AI like MaintainX CoPilot (Enterprise only). AI is in the core product: onboarding, document ingestion, smart prompts, voice summaries, photo diagnosis, natural language queries.

4. **⭐ Smart ID System** — Auto-generated dual ID system (Facility Asset ID + Asset Number/Barcode) with encoded location, department, dependency type, and sequence. No competitor auto-generates meaningful IDs.

5. **⭐ Two-Tier Dependency Model** — Distinguishing between DEPENDS_ON (immediate mechanical coupling) and FEEDS (operational with time buffer). Enables intelligent alerting vs binary "affects/doesn't affect."

6. **⭐ PM Stacking** — Combining multiple PM frequencies that fall on the same day into a single WO. Prevents technician overload and WO spam.

7. **⭐ Red/Yellow/Green Measured Against Due Date** — Not creation date. Seems simple but AE and others get this wrong.

8. **⭐ 30-Minute AI Onboarding** — Conversational setup that replaces weeks of manual data entry. Upload manuals → AI extracts PMs, parts, procedures → review and activate.

9. **⭐ KPIs That Actually Auto-Refresh** — No manual reload after admin changes (direct fix of AE's biggest daily frustration).

10. **⭐ Self-Service Map Builder** — No competitor offers an in-app facility map builder where users can draw zones, place pins, and design their floor plan without professional services. Combined with AI-assisted building (upload a photo → AI suggests layout). DXF/CAD import auto-generates vector floor plans.

11. **⭐ Graph-Powered Predictive Maintenance** — Not just sensor thresholds (any IoT platform does that). Our graph database enables cross-asset prediction: "Asset X failed with this vibration pattern. Asset Y is the same model and trending the same way — inspect now." No competitor connects failure prediction across related assets.

12. **⭐ Voice-First Input for Shop Floor** — Mic button on every text input in the app. AI-structured voice processing: tech says "replaced drive belt, 45 minutes, used one Gates belt" → system parses into action, time, and parts consumed. No competitor treats voice as a first-class input method across the entire app.

13. **⭐ Real Stoplight Visuals** — Three-circle traffic signal indicators (not single colored dots) where active status glows and inactive circles are dim. Instantly readable across a room on TV/kiosk mode.

14. **⭐ Asset Reference Cards with Fix Only / Fix & Train AI** — Quick reference guides surface automatically inside every WO. AI uses reference card + full manual as knowledge base. Two modes: Fix Only (get it running fast) and Fix & Train (learn while you work). AI adapts guidance depth based on tech's experience with that repair type. No competitor offers adaptive AI-guided maintenance training built into the WO workflow.

15. **⭐ VR/AR-Guided Maintenance, 3D Virtual Disassembly & Facility Digital Twin** — Future vision: scan a machine with LiDAR, get a 3D model you can virtually pull apart, with AI highlighting the likely failed component and showing the repair path. Remote expert mode lets senior techs guide junior techs from anywhere. Walk-the-building scanning builds the entire facility (floor plan, asset registry, departments, racking) from a single physical walkthrough — replacing weeks of manual onboarding with a 2-hour walk. No CMMS competitor is even attempting this.

## NOTES & IDEAS (Captured During Sessions)

- **Global theme system:** Light / Dark / System toggle in sidebar footer or Settings. System mode follows OS `prefers-color-scheme`. Floor plan canvas is ALWAYS dark blue regardless of theme.
- Consider grid overlay on floor plans with coordinate system (e.g., D5) for walk-through reference → DECIDED: Alphanumeric grid, numbers 1-15 top, letters A-F side
- MaintainX's in-WO chat threads are their #1 feature — prioritize for Phase 3 → Added to Communication section with voice-to-text
- MaintainX CoPilot is Enterprise-only ($$$). Our AI should be available at lower tiers to undercut.
- Voice notes for WO completion summaries — huge for techs who hate typing
- Photo-to-asset from nameplate — huge time saver during onboarding floor walks
- Anomaly detection on meter readings — flag deviations from historical patterns
- AI-estimated job duration from historical data — helps with resource planning
- Custom fields should be available on ALL entity types (assets, WOs, parts, PMs)
- Saved views/filters should be shareable org-wide (admin creates standard views for team)
- MaintainX weakness: priority levels limited to None/Low/Medium/High, not customizable. We allow custom priorities.
- MaintainX weakness: reports can't be customized, filters reset on revisit. We should persist filter state.
- MaintainX weakness: no indoor floor plan mapping. Our biggest visual differentiator.
- Asset Essentials weakness: KPIs require manual reload after config changes. We fix this with WebSocket.
- Asset Essentials weakness: mobile app sync unreliable. PWA with offline-first fixes this.
- Reference cards should be buildable per asset OR per asset model — one card for "Biesse Rover B 1531" covers all 4 machines. Override at individual asset level if needed.
- Fix Only vs Fix & Train is a training multiplier — every WO becomes an optional learning opportunity. Track which techs have completed "trained" repairs to build a skills matrix over time.
- VR/AR: Start with phone camera AR (lower barrier) before investing in headset-based VR. Phone-based AR can do part scanning and basic overlay guidance immediately.
- 3D model library is a network effect — every customer who scans a Biesse Rover adds to the shared model that all Biesse Rover owners benefit from. This creates a competitive moat.
